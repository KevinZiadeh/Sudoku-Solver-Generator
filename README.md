# Sudoku-Solver-Generator
Inspired by https://github.com/techwithtim

Created a sudoku solver using python inspired by the above user,  then diverted and created a generator and a GUI to both create games and solve existing ones.

Make sure you  have kivy downloaded and run "./python gui.py" in the terminal
