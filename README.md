# Sudoku-Solver-Generator
Inspired by https://github.com/techwithtim/Sudoku-GUI-Solver and https://github.com/uraza/kivy-sudoku-app

Created a sudoku solver using python inspired by the above user,  then diverted and created a generator and a GUI to both create games and solve existing ones.

Make sure you  have kivy downloaded and run "./python gui.py" in the terminal

Generating Sudoku board sometimes crashes program, wait a little bit or press Ctrl+C in terminal
